        so the selector has a perticular anatomy
        lets look at div{margin: 3px; text-align: center;}
        div = selector
        margin=property
        3px= value
        {margin:3px;text-align:center;}=declaration body

    <!--There are many ways to sepcify the type selector
    the way specified above is called the type selector-->

    <!--The type selector can select one or more specific tags to apply
    atributes to-->

    <!--Universal selector = 
    * {color: red;} it is used to select all elements-->

    <!--Class selector = 
    .tst1{text-align: center} preceded by a period. it is applied
    to all elements that have a matching class atribute!-->

    <!--you can combine the type selector and the class selector
    h1.tst1{text-align: center;} applies to all h1 elements that also 
    have a tst1 class atrribuite !!! must have both-->

    <!--Id selectors link
    #tst1{text-align: center;} this will be applied to all
    elements that have a matching id attribute-->

    <!--difference between id and class
    only one element on a page can have the id
    many elements on a page can have a class

    also, while you can use the same class on multiple elements
    you can also use multiple classes on the same element-->

    <!--there are some other kinds on littlewebhut.com that i should
    look at -->
